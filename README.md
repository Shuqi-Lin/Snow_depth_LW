# Snow_depth_LW
This repository is for snow depth calculation model in Lake Winnipeg.

The meteorological data (i.e., air temperature, air pressure, wind speed, precipitation, and est) were used to calculate snow depth during winter at three major sites in Lake Winnipeg (STN 500 in South Basin, STN 502 in Narrow, and STN 505 in North Basin).

A physical model were designed to simulate snow formation and melting on the ice.
